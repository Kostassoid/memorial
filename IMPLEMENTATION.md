# <a id=""></a> Memorial Implementation Notes

## <a id="cli"></a> CLI application

> The application is primarily designed to be run in non-interactive mode (e.g. as a pre-commit hook or during CI).
> Because of that reason and to emphasize using the code and VCS as much as possible (e.g. vs bash history),
> all of the parameters are embedded in a configuration file. With the only exception of verbose mode which can be
> used ad-hoc for figuring out some of the issues with collecting.

### <a id="cli+rendering"></a> Rendering

> Even though the overall design and the config model allow for using multiple renderers
> (even operating over the same collected notes), this feels like a rabbit hole of over-generalization.
> So the idea is to keep Markdown as the one and only renderer until the rest of the project is
> mature enough and there's a clear(er) vision of the roadmap.

## <a id="core"></a> Core

### <a id="core+collector"></a> Collector

> Ignoring parsing errors on collected quotes on (1,1) position to reduce false warnings.

### <a id="core+model"></a> Model

#### <a id="core+model+attributes"></a> Attributes

> Attributes are either attached to the node or control the collection process. 

at [memorial-cli\src\model\attributes.rs (line 1)](https://github.com/Kostassoid/memorial/blob/master/memorial-cli/src/model/attributes.rs#L1)



> Some attributes are used internally to enrich collected knowledge tree with some valuable context,
> like the timestamp of document generation. These attributes are not supposed to be used by end users
> directly. As a convention, these internal attributes are prefixed with "!", although this is not
> enforced through the parser currently.
