# <a id=""></a> Posterity Implementation Notes

## <a id="cli"></a> CLI application

> The application is primarily designed to be run automatically (e.g. as a pre-commit hook or during CI).
> Because of that reason and to emphasize using the code and VCS as much as possible (e.g. vs bash history),
> the only argument for the CLI application for now is just a path to the configuration file.
> Which is also optional. 

at [posterity-cli\src\cli\app.rs (line 25)](https://github.com/Kostassoid/posterity/blob/master/posterity-cli/src/cli/app.rs#L25)



## <a id="core"></a> Core

### <a id="core+collector"></a> Collector

> Ignoring parsing errors on collected quotes on (1,1) position to reduce false warnings. 

at [posterity-cli\src\collector\collector.rs (line 70)](https://github.com/Kostassoid/posterity/blob/master/posterity-cli/src/collector/collector.rs#L70)



### <a id="core+model"></a> Model

#### <a id="core+model+attributes"></a> Attributes

> Attributes are either attached to the node or control the collection process. 

at [posterity-cli\src\model\attributes.rs (line 1)](https://github.com/Kostassoid/posterity/blob/master/posterity-cli/src/model/attributes.rs#L1)



> Some attributes are used internally to enrich collected knowledge tree with some valuable context,
> like the timestamp of document generation. These attributes are not supposed to be used by end users
> directly. As a convention, these internal attributes are prefixed with "!", although this is not
> enforced through the parser currently.
